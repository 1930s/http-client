{-|
This script downloads the public suffix list from mozilla's website, and uses
Network.PublicSuffixList.Create.sink to construct an opaque data structure which can
be used with the isSuffix function in Network.PublicSuffixList.Lookup. It then
generates a source file with the contents of this data structure so that
applications can link against this source file and get knowledget of public suffixes
without doing anything at runtime.

Run this script like so:
$ runhaskell -DCREATE Create.hs
